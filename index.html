               <p>One of the benefits of having a remote position is to have the ability and freedom to
                   not be tied to a single location. With the right setup, all you need is a phone, laptop,
                  and a internet connection to complete projects and necessary tasks. This opens a new world 
                  for someone like me who has always wanted to travel. This is not an all-inclusive list,
                  these are some of the locations I would <b>LOVE</b> to visit.<p>

                        <p>Let me introduce you to our <b>Wildcat</b>! It is cozy when you fit in all 7 of 
                           our tribe, but it keeps us safe when we do our "exploring". Camping, fishing, 
                           hiking...there is nothing stopping us from connecting with Mother Nature! </p>
                        <h3>Dollywood, Here We Come!</h3>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Ever since I first saw the beautiful mountain scenery, I was hooked. I had heard 
                           about the cabins, but I found out that there are RV camp sites. This would be
                            a welcome break from city life.</p>
                        <h3>The Painted Cliffs</h3>

                        </figure>
                        <p>This national park includes one of the seven natural wonders of the world. 
                           There is a beauty to the gorge that cannot be described in words and I'm sure 
                           pictures alone do not do it justice.</p>
                        <h3>Perfect for a Speedster Race</h3>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Just take one look at the pictures of this park and the geek in me transported to 
                           the sands of Tatooine. Yes, it is empty but serene. The natural arches are majestic
                           and inviting. The arches are calling...</p>
                        <h3>Old Faithful and the Super Volcano</h3>

                        </figure>
                        <p>I mean, it's an epic geyser powered by a supervolcano...enough said.</p>

                  <h2>Island Hopping</h2>
                     <h3>No Passport Needed</h3>
                     <figure>
                        <img src="images/PR1.jpg" alt="Puerto Rico" align="middle">

                     </figure>
                     <p>This island provides the appeal of the islands while also providing the affordability
                        of traveling domestically. This would be a great destination to introduce us to the 
                        tropics!
                     </p>
                     <h3>My Dream Wedding Destination</h3>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                     <p>This island has been on my travel bucket list for most of my adult life. The serene 
                        laid back atmosphere and beautiful landscapes have been calling to me for years and
                        I am so excited to step on the sandy shores.</p>
                     <h3>A Little Piece of Heaven</h3>
                     <figure>

                        <figcaption>Maldives</figcaption>
                     </figure>
                     <p> This is the another island destination on my bucket list. This would be used as a
                        retirement island trip for my husband and me. The thought of staying in our little hut
                        in this remote island resort drinking a cocktail of our choice while relaxing completely 
                        is the heaven we paradise we desperately long for. And I am convinced, we WILL make it there.

                  <h2>Tracing My Roots</h2>
                  <h3>Back to the Africa</h3>

                  </figure>
                  <p>I have always been interested in tracing my roots and unfortunately hit a dead end 
                     when using the records available. I eventually took a DNA test and was able to 
                     narrow down the countries my ancestors originated from. My ancestors were prodominently
                     West African, more specifically Nigerian. I would would to visit and have my family and 
                     I learn about the traditions and culture that we were never able to experience ourselves.
                  </p>
                  <h3>The Pipes are Calling</h3>
                  <figure>

                  <figcaption>The Irish Isles</figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>On the other hand, I have heard many stories about other parts of my ancestry. One portion 
                  that I have not only been able to confirm, but also trace is the Irish piece of my family. 
                  I assumed it ony existed on my father's side based on family stories, so I was shocked to 
                  see some Irish relatives pop up on my mother's side. This led me to uncover I family register 
                  that led into the 1700s and back to a family church. I would love to go once and retrace some 
                  of the areas where my ancestors lived.
